        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice the onion and heat the oil in the bottom of a large pan. <br>
                Add onion, mustard and salt, fry over medium heat for 4-5 minutes. <br>
                If you don't have mustard, read the tips.</li>
            <li>Add the cumin, turmeric, chilli and cinnamon to the fried onion. <br>
                Stir, fry for several seconds and add coconut milk, tomatoes, soy <br>
                sauce and sugar. Increase the heat to maximum and cook for <br>
                5 - 8 minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly and becomes glossy.</li>
            <li>Add the drained chickpeas, reduce heat to medium and cook for <br>
                5-6 minutes. Season to taste with salt or more cane sugar if needed. <br>
                Serve with rice and your favorite vegetables that can be dipped in <br>
                a creamy sauce.</li>

        </ol>
        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you don't have mustard, omit it and add 1 teaspoon of mustard <br>
                to the curry together with the soy sauce.</li>
            <li>Black mustard will be best for this recipe, but ordinary yellow <br>
                will be good too, then it is worth adding a little more of it.</li>
            <li>The curry is still cooking without the lid, thanks to which the sauce <br>
                has a chance to evaporate and acquire a buttery, creamy taste.</li>
            <li>Longer frying of onions with mustard seeds allows to flavor the oil <br>
                and soften the onion properly.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this recipe, you will get a lot of aquafaba, i.e. brine from <br>
                a jar or can. Under no circumstances do not pour it out, just use it <br>
                to make chocolate mousse, mayonnaise or fluffy pancakes.</li>
        </ul>

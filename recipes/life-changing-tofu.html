                <li>2 cubes of natural tofu (2x180 g)</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons of potato flour</li>
                <li>oil</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
                <li>3 tbsp agave syrup or other sweetener</li>
                <li>1/4 - 1/3 cup of water</li>
                <li>2 - 3 cm of ginger</li>
                <li>1-2 garlic clove</li>
                <li>to serve: chives, black pepper</p>
            </ul>
        <h3>Preparation:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Cut the tofu into cubes, put it in a bag, pour in the <br> 
                    potato flour and shake it until it is evenly coated in <br> 
                    flour. Do not throw away the bag, shake it out and <br> 
                    leave it to coat the tofu in flour.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    In the bottom of the largest frying pan you have, <br>
                    heat enough oil to cover the entire bottom. Don't <br>
                    worry, the tofu won't be greasy.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Gently place the breaded tofu cubes in the hot oil <br>
                    and fry for 3-4 minutes on one side, until the breading<br>
                    is warm and crispy. Then turn and cook the same on <br>
                    the other side.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    In the meantime, prepare a plate lined with a paper <br>
                    towel and make the sauce. Add the soy sauce, agave <br>
                    syrup and water to the glass. Grate the ginger on the <br>
                    fine holes of the grater, about two teaspoons should be <br>
                    collected, and the garlic. Add to the ingredients in the <br>
                    glass and mix well.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <em>New improved version:</em> Put the fried tofu on a paper <br>
                     towel for a while. Pour the sauce into a smaller pan <br>
                     and heat over the highest heat until the sauce begins to <br>
                     bubble intensely, then add the tofu. Stir constantly, and <br>
                     when the tofu is covered with sauce, it's ready. Sprinkle <br>
                     with chives and black pepper and serve with rice or <br>
                     your favorite Asian noodles. Outstanding the next day <br>
                     in the lunchbox. Note, apparently it disappears overnight <br>
                     from the fridge.
                </li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The less water you add to the sauce, the crunchier the tofu will be.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Potato flour (starch) can possibly be replaced with corn flour: it will <br>
                    give a more crunchy, American effect. Or the less popular tapioca <br>
                    flour, which gives an almost identical effect. No other flour will work <br>
                    in this recipe!
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Agave syrup, maple syrup, cane sugar, stevia, erythritol - any sweetener <br>
                    will be good, as long as the tofu has an exciting, sweet and salty taste. <br>
                    If you use liquid sweeteners, add them as much as in the recipe, if you <br>
                    use sugar, add a little less.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    If you don't like washing dishes and you have a lot of free time, wait <br>
                    until the oil cools down after frying the tofu - be careful, it's very hot, <br>
                    it will take several minutes! - and pour it out. Then wipe the pan carelessly <br>
                    and you can prepare the second part of the dish on it.
                </li>
            </ul>

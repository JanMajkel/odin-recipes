        <img src="../images/mustard-tofu.jpg" alt="Mustard Tofu Photo">
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cubes of tofu, each 250 g</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mustard, table or sarepska</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of dark beer</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of maple syrup</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1 onion, cut into eighths</li>        
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Drain the tofu cubes from the brine and cut lengthwise <br>
                into three slices - so as to obtain thin, oblong, rectangular <br>
                pieces.</li>
            <li>Mix all marinade ingredients in a jar. Then pour a few <br>
                tablespoons of marinade into the bottom of the rectangular <br>
                container, arrange the slices of tofu, pour a few tablespoons <br>
                of marinade over them again, put the last pieces of tofu on <br>
                top and pour out the rest of the marinade. Cover with a large <br>
                piece of foil, and put a jar of jam or other preserves on it - <br>
                thanks to the weight, the tofu will marinate better.</li>
            <li>Leave in the fridge for the whole night. The next day, grill on <br>
                the grill, basting with the remaining marinade if necessary. <br>
                Sprinkle with black pepper, serve with bread and your favorite <br>
                toppings.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If your tofu cubes are smaller, you can prepare the same <br>
                amount of marinade and add a few mushrooms or zucchini <br>
                slices to the tofu.</li>
            <li>Both natural and smoked tofu will work well in this recipe.</li>
            <li>You can serve them in the form of a large steak, or cut them <br>
                into cubes and put them on skewers.</li>
            <li>Instead of beer, you can pour natural apple or pear juice into <br>
                the marinade.</li>
        </ul>
